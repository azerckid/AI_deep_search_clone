The program aims to provide off-grid power for military installations, communication networks, weapons systems and command nodes.Janus was born out of four executive orders signed by President Trump in May to accelerate nuclear deployment. One of them directed the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop three pilot reactors by July 2026, while another instructed the DOD to build a reactor on a military installation by September 2028.Advertisement · Scroll to continueWhile many of the companies selected for  aim to build reactors of between 20 MW and 75 MW, the DOD is focusing on microreactors, which feature capacities of between 1 MW and 20 MW and are designed to be fully transportable.The DOD’s first effort to promote SMRs as a military solution was Project Pele, which was launched in 2019 to provide 24/7 electricity for military operations in remote and challenging environments. BWXT Advanced Technologies started building a 1.5 MW mobile reactor under the project at Idaho National Laboratory in September 2024.The DOD’s latest SMR program, Project Janus, is part of the Advanced Nuclear Power for Installations (ANPI) program, announced jointly in April 2024 by the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), Army and Air Force to develop microreactors on military sites.Advertisement · Scroll to continue**MAP: US operational nuclear power plants as of February 2025**!Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration. The DOD is expected to issue a Request for Proposals “in a few weeks” to select the companies that will take part in the Janus program, law firm Pillsbury said in a report on October 21.Chosen companies will build their reactors at specific army installations, with Janus providing uranium fuel cycle and broader supply chain support, said Stephen Comello, Senior Vice President, Strategic Initiatives at the EFI Foundation, a non-profit organisation focused on the energy transition.While DOE awardees are responsible for all costs and activities relating to site identification, fuel supply, reactor development and spent fuel storage, those involved in the Janus program will benefit from some level of federal funding and allocated military sites, Comello said.DOE laboratory teams that contributed to “the technical, policy and legal aspects of Project Pele are expected to collaborate again with the Army as the Janus initiative moves forward,” Pillsbury said._Join us at_  _and network with over 700 utilities, developers, financiers, technology suppliers and regulators._In October, Radiant Industries signed the first agreement to develop a microreactor on a U.S. military base as part of the ANPI program and a separate deal to build a microreactor factory on the Manhattan Project site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, that would start producing the company’s 1 MW Kaleidos microreactor in 2028, with the goal of eventually manufacturing 50 units a year.Seven other companies are also eligible for the ANPI program: Antares Nuclear, BWXT, General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems, Kairos Power, Oklo, Westinghouse and X-Energy.\\\\u202fRadiant and Oklo are participating in both the DOD – which was renamed the Department of War (DOW) by President Trump in April – and DOE programs.**DOE, DOD synergies**The DOD’s microreactor initiative is “a demand signal for resilient, clean power and it is complementary to DOE’s work, which is good for the whole advanced reactor industry,” said Bonita Chester, Oklo Head of Communications and Media. It can help “standardize components, strengthen fuel and manufacturing supply chains, and grow the specialized workforce,” she told Reuters Events.There could be synergies between the DOE and DOD initiatives. For instance, Antares is working with the DOE to license its prototype reactor, while the DOD could be a transition pathway from prototypes to future commercial units, where the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) would have pre-existing familiarity with its technology, Jordan Bramble, the CEO of developer Antares Nuclear, told Reuters Events._Download our exclusive report on_  _._An X-energy spokesperson said the company fully supports “the intent of recent DOE programs aimed at advancing commercial microreactor development” but had prioritised its relations with the DOD as the best conduit for progressing its Xenith microreactor.“We believe that the [Defense] Department’s efforts provide a clear path to deployment, one that supports both military and commercial applications,” the spokesperson told Reuters Events.**CHART: Small modular reactor projects by country**!Source: International Energy Agency report \\\\\\'Electricity 2024: Analysis and Forecast to 2026.\\\\\\' Faster project safety reviews are not guaranteed simply because of DOD involvement but “Janus program applicants may see efficiencies garnered from interagency agreements, coordination, and information sharing between the NRC, DOE and DOD,” Comello told Reuters Events.Moreover, DOD regulations limit environmental assessment reviews to a maximum of one year, with no more than two years for environmental impact statements. By comparison, the NRC took 41 months to complete a design review for NuScale, the only SMR developer to have secured an NRC licence to date. NuScale says that it set “a record as the fastest design review in the NRC’s history.”**Commercial deployment**This initiative will almost certainly help companies like Antares “bridge the gap between prototype reactors and commercially viable performance, capacity factors and economics,” Bramble said.Follow-on commercial sector customers are likely to be “extractive industries, industrial power and heat, remote communities, state and municipal critical infrastructure, data centers, utilities, and potentially U.S. allies,” he added._For exclusive nuclear insights,_  _to our newsletter._X-energy said it plans to advance its 3 to 10 MW Xenith microreactor for both the military and commercial markets and so intends to pursue regulatory approval from the NRC in parallel to its work through ANPI. Apart from the military, it aims to deploy its reactors at ports, hospitals, logistics hubs and water treatment facilities.The company applied for a construction permit to build its first reactor at the Long Mott plant in Calhoun County, Texas, in March 2025, with the aim of completing it in the early 2030s.DOD initiatives may produce restricted configurations for defense missions but “derivative commercial versions\" of the same core technology can be developed concurrently for the civilian market under NRC regulation, said the X-energy spokesperson.Any microreactor intended for commercial operation would still be subject to the NRC’s licensing process, they added.--Editing by Eduardo GarciaOpinions expressed are those of the author.

The construction of prototypes such as CAREM-25 in Argentina and KLT40S in the Russian Federation and the progress of other designs indicate that SMRs are becoming a more viable option for nuclear .To assess the potential market for SMRs in the short to medium term, the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) is collecting and analyzing economic and market data, including factory production cost estimates. This project will provide a better understanding of the economic viability of SMRs and help inform decision-makers on the role of SMRs in the future of nuclear power generation.It is worth noting that SMRs face several challenges, including regulatory hurdles and the need for significant investment in research and development. However, if these challenges can be overcome, SMRs could play a significant role in meeting the growing demand for energy while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Growing global electricity demand and the flexibility of SMRs in terms of size and power output are some factors driving the global small modular reactor market. The older generation of nuclear power plants is extensive and requires significant capital and building time. Atomic reactors are challenging to install in areas far from large . As a result, setting up a  in remote locations is not feasible, paving the way for developing smaller atomic reactors. With a greater emphasis on achieving political and technological solutions to climate change, many experts worldwide highlight nuclear reactors\\\\\\' virtually emissions-free power.In August 2022 the DOE\\\\\\'s Nuclear Energy University Program approved funds to Core Power, the MIT Energy Initiative, and Idaho National Laboratory (INL) to research the economic and environmental benefits of floating advanced nuclear power generation.## Market Trends- The rapid growth of generative AI is transforming industries by automating tasks, enhancing creativity, and introducing new risks and opportunities.- The rising focus on sustainability, with a commitment to  and transparent reporting drives the growth of the market.- The widespread adoption of 5G technology is enabling advancements in connected devices, smart cities, and real-time data processing, particularly impacting manufacturing and healthcare sectors.## Market Scope|     |     || --- | --- || **Report Coverage** | **Details** || Market Size in 2025 | USD 7.49 Billion || Market Size in 2026 | USD 8.16 Billion || Market Size by 2034 | USD 16.13 Billion || Growth Rate from 2025 to 2034 | CAGR of 8.9% || Largest Market | Asia Pacific || Base Year | 2025 || Forecast Period | 2025 to 2034 || Segments Covered | Reactor Type, Application and Region || Regions Covered | North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East & Africa |## Market Dynamics### Drivers**Increasing electricity demand**Increasing residential and industrial electricity usage encourages governments to prioritize sustainable power over conventional power generation to reduce their carbon footprint. Furthermore, the increasing electrification of connected devices, transportation, and other critical services is increasing the demand for more power, increasing the demand for tiny modular reactors emitting less carbon. For instance, according to world energy & Climate statistics, global energy consumption shows 5% growth in 2021, After a 4.5% decline in 2020.The growing interest in developing renewable energy sources is expected to open significant industry opportunities. Furthermore, governments worldwide are aware of the deteriorating environmental balance and are taking necessary steps to restore it, including imposing strict limits on hazardous emissions. As a result of these regulations, new investors are flocking to compact modular reactors. Aside from that, the capital needed to construct a small modular reactor facility is less than that required to build a traditional nuclear facility. Small modular reactors necessitate less construction, which reduces investment costs.### Challenges**Regulatory barriers**The first and most significant challenge is the presence of regulatory barriers. Many SMR designs include novel features such as enhanced passive safety systems and multi-modular deployment (i.e., multiple reactor modules on the same site or pool). NuScale, for example). The SMR vendors argue that these features could reduce operational staffing requirements (see discussion in Rothwell, 2016: 168) and the size of emergency planning zones due to the application of regulations. As for any NPP, the safety and  requirements for SMR are precise, but the question is how SMR will demonstrate that they can meet those requirements. Regulators and technical support organizations will also require time to decide on these options and innovations, which may cause delays.### Opportunities**Reduction of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere**SMRs have the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They could provide an alternative baseload power source, allowing the retirement of older, smaller, and less efficient coal-fired power plants that would otherwise not be suitable for retrofitting with carbon capture and storage technology. They could be used in the U.S. and the world where other carbon-free energy sources, such as solar and wind, are scarce. There could be technical or commercial constraints, such as expected energy demand growth and transmission capacity, allowing SMRs but not GW-scale LWRs to be installed. The manufacturing base required for SMRs can be established domestically, which is critical for onshore production.## Segments Insights### Reactor Type InsightsBased on the reactor type, heavy water reactors dominated the market. The heavy water reactors are significantly more expensive than ordinary light water, it provides improved substantially neutron economy, allowing the reactor to operate without fuel enrichment facilities (offsetting the additional expense of the heavy water) and improving the reactor\\\\\\'s ability to use alternate fuel cycles. Furthermore, heavy water reactors regulate their isotopic purity for optimal reactor physics performance. For example, increasing the isotopic purity of heavy water improves fuel economy and reduces waste generation. This can be accomplished by minimizing light water ingress into heavy water systems and maximizing the purity of recovered water before it is returned to the reactor. p in controlling isotopic purity to achieve optimal reactor physics performance.### Application InsightsBased on application, the power generation segment dominated the small modular market in 2024and is expected to continue to lead during the forecast period.On the other hand, the desalination segment is the second fastest-growing market owing to the increasing demand for potable water in semi-arid and arid zones.**!**Small molecular reactors are used for nuclear desalination, and where portable water is produced from seawater in the facility. Desalination plants are designed to make portable water or used as co-generation atomic power plants to generate electricity.## Regional Insights### Asia Pacific Small Modular Reactor Market Size and Growth 2025 to 2034The Asia Pacific small modular reactor market size was estimated at USD 5.99 billion in 2025 and is predicted to be worth around USD 12.90 billion by 2034, at a CAGR of 9.1% from 2025 to 2034.**!****Asia Pacific is dominating the** **small modular reactor market and** **is expected to grow in the forecast period**China is highly active in the field of SMRs, with many designs, competition among various manufacturers, and many projects in the planning and construction stages. China is interested in using SMRs for multiple applications, including electricity generation, process, and district heating. China funds several research, development, and demonstration programs for advanced reactors, including Generation III and IV, for commercial and sustainable development.Nuclear power has grown dramatically in China over the last decade because of political decisions to promote technology. The potential market for SMRs is significant within China. How well this translates to the export potential for the SMR designs remains to be seen, as the only Chinese NPP built outside of China is in Pakistan. Various regulatory and other issues could act as roadblocks.!Nowadays, Interest in SMRs has been steadily increasing, but this interest has yet to be translated into many projects. SMR deployment plans are apparent in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, China, and Russia. When contemplating deploying new SMR designs, the FOAK plants become significant for the future, as they can be viewed as demonstration plants in some cases, particularly for non-LWR structures. With clear, national-level interest in the project, the number of actors willing to take a risk on a FOAK SMR is unlimited. Government such as US and UK have signalled their interest in supporting a new build and then exporting the technology. Without this level of support, It is presumable that many designs will die in innovation valley death.U.S. has provided larger-scale support for SMRs since 2012 when the Department of Energy (DOE) allocated USD 450 million to develop an advanced US-based LWR. Initially, the B&W mPower design was given permission, which was later shelved. The DOE has supported a variety of plant designs, but the NuScale 60 MWe SMR is currently the design with the most funding behind it. NuScale is presently undergoing NRC design certification, which is expected to be completed by 2022. The first fully commercial 12-module and 720 MWe plants are expected to come online by 2027 at DOE\\\\\\'s Idaho National Laboratory site.The UK government announced a grant of £210 million to Rolls-Royce SMR to match private investment in this venture in 2021. Rolls-Royce Group, BNF Resources UK, and Exelon Generation will each invest £195 million in it over the next three years. According to Rolls-Royce, the SMR business will now \"proceed rapidly with a range of parallel delivery activities, including entry into the UK generic design assessment (GDA) process and identifying sites for the factories that will manufacture the modules that enable onsite assembly of the power plants.\" The reactor is intended to produce hydrogen and , as well as the generation of electricity. In addition, Rolls-Royce announced in November 2022 that it had identified four priority locations in the UK for the construction of SMR-based power stations, including Trawsfynydd, Wylfa, and Old bury. All of the sites are on land owned by the UK Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA). Before the NDA commits to SMR development, the Department of Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy must first approve it.## Small Modular Reactor MarketCompanies- - - Fluor Corporation- GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy- Holtec International- IHI Corporation- Leadcold Reactors AB- Mitsubishi Power Ltd.- Moltex Energy Ltd.- NuScale Power- LLC.- OKBM Afrikantov- Rolls-Royce plc- SNC-Lavalin Group### Recent Development- In 2022, The French government announced that the Nuward SMR design will be included in the France 2030 plan, granting it access to $1.1 billion (€1 billion) in public funding.

UK-based Tokamak Energy has recorded a significant breakthrough in the development of clean energy by successfully replicating fusion power plant fields within its Demo4 magnet system.This is the first time in the world that such fields have been created in a full High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) magnet configuration.During recent tests conducted at the company’s headquarters near Oxford, the Demo4 system achieved magnetic field strengths of 11.8 Tesla at a temperature of -243 degrees Celsius (-405.4 degrees Fahrenheit).interestingengineering.com# interestingengineering.com is blockedThis page has been blocked by an extension- Try disabling your extensions.ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENTReloadThis page has been blocked by an extension![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)The system, which features a complete set of HTS magnets built in a tokamak configuration, successfully managed seven million ampere-turns of electrical current through its central column.Warrick Matthews, CEO of Tokamak Energy, described the results as a “major victory” for the sector.“Demo4 represents over a decade of HTS innovation at Tokamak Energy. Born from our fusion mission, it validates one of the technical solutions for getting clean, limitless, safe and secure fusion energy on the grid,” Matthews said.## Validating system-level performanceCreating fusion energy requires extremely  to confine and control hydrogen fuel, which is heated to a plasma state several times hotter than the sun’s core. While single high-field HTS magnets have been demonstrated previously, Demo4 addresses the next critical engineering challenge: validating a complete magnet system.In a functioning fusion power plant, superconducting tapes must operate within a complex magnetic environment created by neighboring coils. These conditions significantly influence structural performance and critical current.Demo4 allows engineers to generate and study these fusion-relevant forces across a system coil set, which includes 14 toroidal field magnets and two poloidal field magnets.Graham Dunbar, Demo4 chief engineer, noted that the platform is providing unique engineering data to inform future power plant designs.“This isn’t just about achieving a number; it’s about gaining the confidence and build expertise to scale our technology for future energy-producing fusion systems,” Dunbar .## Commercial applications beyond fusionThe tests also highlighted the commercial potential of HTS technology for sectors outside of fusion energy.HTS materials can deliver approximately 200 times the current density of copper, making them viable for power distribution in data centers, electric motors for zero-emission flight, and magnetic levitation transport systems.According to the company, these magnets can be made smaller and lighter than traditional low-temperature superconductors and operate at a fraction of the cooling cost.Tokamak Energy indicated that further testing to reach higher magnetic fields is ongoing, with the next set of results expected in early 2026.## High-speed plasma imageryIn a related development, the firm earlier released the first high-speed color images of plasma captured inside a fusion energy machine, offering new visual insights into the behavior of the fuel.This research supports the advancement of , a promising operating mode for future fusion power plants. XPR regimes are designed to cool the plasma’s edge before it contacts reactor components, reducing wear on the hardware without compromising performance.The ability to visualize how lithium interacts with the plasma in real-time serves as a significant step toward validating this enabling technology.### Recommended Articles!Get the latest in engineering, tech, space & science - delivered daily to your inbox.Sign up for freeBy subscribing, you agree to ourandYou may unsubscribe at any time.0COMMENTBy An active and versatile journalist and news editor.

leading to July 2025- The year’s investment total is the highest since 2022 and a178% rise from last year- Total funding for the 53 fusion companies stands at $9.766 billion, a five-fold increase since 202122 July 2025: The fusion industry raised $2.64 billion in private and public funding in the 12 months leading to July 2025, according to the annual  by the Fusion Industry Association (FIA). The figure marks a significant increase from 2024 and is the second highest yearly fusion funding figure since the report began, after the 2022 record year.Now in its fifth year, the report provides a comprehensive view of the growth of the fusion sector and progress towards commercial fusion deployment. This year, 53 fusion companies responded – up from 23 in 2021 – with eight new entrants since last year.This year’s total figure includes several major funding rounds including the $900m Series A for US-based Pacific Fusion, which came out of stealth mode in November 2024. Other significant rounds included a $425m Series F for US-based Helion in January 2025, and €113m Series B for Germany-based Marvel Fusion.Despite the acceleration in funding, 83% of respondents still consider investment a major challenge. And when asked how much more investment each company would need to bring their first pilot plants online, answers ranged from $3m to $12.5 bn, with a median response of $700m. Giving a total of $77 billion, this is eight times more than has been committed to the industry to date, though the report emphasizes that this should not be taken as the total investment needed, as there will inevitably be some consolidation, with a smaller number of market leaders emerging.Nonetheless, fusion companies remain confident in their timelines for delivering fusion-generated electricity to the grid, with 84% of respondents believing this will happen before the end of the 2030s and 53% by 2035.The report also highlights that backing is coming from a wide range of investors, including deep tech venture capital firms like DCVC and Breakthrough Energy Ventures; industrial giants such as Chevron, Siemens Energy, and Nucor; sovereign and quasi-public funds including In-Q-Tel, the European Innovation Council Fund, and Plynth Energy; and strategic players from the energy sector like Shell Ventures and Energy Impact Partners.The amount of public funding invested in fusion companies also increased by 84% from last year, growing by almost $360 million to nearly $800 million in total.More than half of the fusion energy startups in the report are based in the US (29), while a further 13 are in Europe. The remainder are operating in countries across Asia and Oceania. The survey showed fusion companies directly employ 4,607 people and support at least 9,300 supply chain jobs, though this is likely an undercount as not all companies provided employee data. Since 2021, the number of people employed directly by fusion companies has more than quadrupled.> “With a half-decade of consistent data, we can now identify clear trends that speak to both the promise and challenges of commercial fusion energy. The acceleration of capital, even when the global economy has tightened, is a signal of maturing investor confidence, technological progress, and a rapidly coalescing supply chain. The maturation of the ecosystem, and increased interest from governments via public-private partnerships show fusion is no longer a purely scientific effort; it is a global industrial movement.”>> FIA CEO Andrew Holland**About the Report** This is the fifth annual Global Fusion Industry Report from the Fusion Industry Association. Responses are based on answers to a survey issued to private fusion companies. We approached the fusion developers that we know about and where contact information was available. 52 companies responded to the survey this year. One is in stealth mode so not named. A 53rd did not respond to this year’s survey but confirmed inclusion with last year’s data. All responses are voluntary, and we strive to be impartial and transparent, presenting information on the various companies as it has been conveyed to us. This survey should be seen as a snapshot in time; a view of the industry when the survey was conducted in the second quarter of 2025. Repeating the activity year-on-year enables us to see the picture evolving.Many private fusion companies are members of the Fusion Industry Association, though this is not a requirement for the report, and we strive to treat members and non-members the same. Membership of the FIA requires companies to have a plan for fusion commercialization, to demonstrate private investment to support their mission, and to pay dues. Companies playing a supportive role in the fusion industry as suppliers, customers, and advocacy organizations may join as Affiliate Members, but these wider-industry companies are not the subject of this report.**About The Fusion Industry Association (FIA)** The FIA is the leading voice of the fusion industry and a central point for coordination across the global fusion community to support accelerated growth.Share on Facebook]( Tweet](\\'}, {\\'title\\': \\'Global fusion energy investment surges to $2.64bn\\', \\'url\\': \\'https://www.power-technology.com/news/global-fusion-energy-investment-surges-64bn/\\', \\'markdown\\': \\' ![]( fusion, the powerhouse behind the sun and stars, remains in a developmental phase on Earth.

The program aims to provide off-grid power for military installations, communication networks, weapons systems and command nodes.Janus was born out of four executive orders signed by President Trump in May to accelerate nuclear deployment. One of them directed the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop three pilot reactors by July 2026, while another instructed the DOD to build a reactor on a military installation by September 2028.Advertisement · Scroll to continueWhile many of the companies selected for  aim to build reactors of between 20 MW and 75 MW, the DOD is focusing on microreactors, which feature capacities of between 1 MW and 20 MW and are designed to be fully transportable.The DOD’s first effort to promote SMRs as a military solution was Project Pele, which was launched in 2019 to provide 24/7 electricity for military operations in remote and challenging environments. BWXT Advanced Technologies started building a 1.5 MW mobile reactor under the project at Idaho National Laboratory in September 2024.The DOD’s latest SMR program, Project Janus, is part of the Advanced Nuclear Power for Installations (ANPI) program, announced jointly in April 2024 by the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), Army and Air Force to develop microreactors on military sites.Advertisement · Scroll to continue**MAP: US operational nuclear power plants as of February 2025**!Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration. The DOD is expected to issue a Request for Proposals “in a few weeks” to select the companies that will take part in the Janus program, law firm Pillsbury said in a report on October 21.Chosen companies will build their reactors at specific army installations, with Janus providing uranium fuel cycle and broader supply chain support, said Stephen Comello, Senior Vice President, Strategic Initiatives at the EFI Foundation, a non-profit organisation focused on the energy transition.While DOE awardees are responsible for all costs and activities relating to site identification, fuel supply, reactor development and spent fuel storage, those involved in the Janus program will benefit from some level of federal funding and allocated military sites, Comello said.DOE laboratory teams that contributed to “the technical, policy and legal aspects of Project Pele are expected to collaborate again with the Army as the Janus initiative moves forward,” Pillsbury said._Join us at_  _and network with over 700 utilities, developers, financiers, technology suppliers and regulators._In October, Radiant Industries signed the first agreement to develop a microreactor on a U.S. military base as part of the ANPI program and a separate deal to build a microreactor factory on the Manhattan Project site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, that would start producing the company’s 1 MW Kaleidos microreactor in 2028, with the goal of eventually manufacturing 50 units a year.Seven other companies are also eligible for the ANPI program: Antares Nuclear, BWXT, General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems, Kairos Power, Oklo, Westinghouse and X-Energy.\\u202fRadiant and Oklo are participating in both the DOD – which was renamed the Department of War (DOW) by President Trump in April – and DOE programs.**DOE, DOD synergies**The DOD’s microreactor initiative is “a demand signal for resilient, clean power and it is complementary to DOE’s work, which is good for the whole advanced reactor industry,” said Bonita Chester, Oklo Head of Communications and Media. It can help “standardize components, strengthen fuel and manufacturing supply chains, and grow the specialized workforce,” she told Reuters Events.There could be synergies between the DOE and DOD initiatives. For instance, Antares is working with the DOE to license its prototype reactor, while the DOD could be a transition pathway from prototypes to future commercial units, where the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) would have pre-existing familiarity with its technology, Jordan Bramble, the CEO of developer Antares Nuclear, told Reuters Events._Download our exclusive report on_  _._An X-energy spokesperson said the company fully supports “the intent of recent DOE programs aimed at advancing commercial microreactor development” but had prioritised its relations with the DOD as the best conduit for progressing its Xenith microreactor.“We believe that the [Defense] Department’s efforts provide a clear path to deployment, one that supports both military and commercial applications,” the spokesperson told Reuters Events.**CHART: Small modular reactor projects by country**!Source: International Energy Agency report \\'Electricity 2024: Analysis and Forecast to 2026.\\' Faster project safety reviews are not guaranteed simply because of DOD involvement but “Janus program applicants may see efficiencies garnered from interagency agreements, coordination, and information sharing between the NRC, DOE and DOD,” Comello told Reuters Events.Moreover, DOD regulations limit environmental assessment reviews to a maximum of one year, with no more than two years for environmental impact statements. By comparison, the NRC took 41 months to complete a design review for NuScale, the only SMR developer to have secured an NRC licence to date. NuScale says that it set “a record as the fastest design review in the NRC’s history.”**Commercial deployment**This initiative will almost certainly help companies like Antares “bridge the gap between prototype reactors and commercially viable performance, capacity factors and economics,” Bramble said.Follow-on commercial sector customers are likely to be “extractive industries, industrial power and heat, remote communities, state and municipal critical infrastructure, data centers, utilities, and potentially U.S. allies,” he added._For exclusive nuclear insights,_  _to our newsletter._X-energy said it plans to advance its 3 to 10 MW Xenith microreactor for both the military and commercial markets and so intends to pursue regulatory approval from the NRC in parallel to its work through ANPI. Apart from the military, it aims to deploy its reactors at ports, hospitals, logistics hubs and water treatment facilities.The company applied for a construction permit to build its first reactor at the Long Mott plant in Calhoun County, Texas, in March 2025, with the aim of completing it in the early 2030s.DOD initiatives may produce restricted configurations for defense missions but “derivative commercial versions\" of the same core technology can be developed concurrently for the civilian market under NRC regulation, said the X-energy spokesperson.Any microreactor intended for commercial operation would still be subject to the NRC’s licensing process, they added.--Editing by Eduardo GarciaOpinions expressed are those of the author.

The construction of prototypes such as CAREM-25 in Argentina and KLT40S in the Russian Federation and the progress of other designs indicate that SMRs are becoming a more viable option for nuclear .To assess the potential market for SMRs in the short to medium term, the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) is collecting and analyzing economic and market data, including factory production cost estimates. This project will provide a better understanding of the economic viability of SMRs and help inform decision-makers on the role of SMRs in the future of nuclear power generation.It is worth noting that SMRs face several challenges, including regulatory hurdles and the need for significant investment in research and development. However, if these challenges can be overcome, SMRs could play a significant role in meeting the growing demand for energy while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Growing global electricity demand and the flexibility of SMRs in terms of size and power output are some factors driving the global small modular reactor market. The older generation of nuclear power plants is extensive and requires significant capital and building time. Atomic reactors are challenging to install in areas far from large . As a result, setting up a  in remote locations is not feasible, paving the way for developing smaller atomic reactors. With a greater emphasis on achieving political and technological solutions to climate change, many experts worldwide highlight nuclear reactors\\' virtually emissions-free power.In August 2022 the DOE\\'s Nuclear Energy University Program approved funds to Core Power, the MIT Energy Initiative, and Idaho National Laboratory (INL) to research the economic and environmental benefits of floating advanced nuclear power generation.## Market Trends- The rapid growth of generative AI is transforming industries by automating tasks, enhancing creativity, and introducing new risks and opportunities.- The rising focus on sustainability, with a commitment to  and transparent reporting drives the growth of the market.- The widespread adoption of 5G technology is enabling advancements in connected devices, smart cities, and real-time data processing, particularly impacting manufacturing and healthcare sectors.## Market Scope|     |     || --- | --- || **Report Coverage** | **Details** || Market Size in 2025 | USD 7.49 Billion || Market Size in 2026 | USD 8.16 Billion || Market Size by 2034 | USD 16.13 Billion || Growth Rate from 2025 to 2034 | CAGR of 8.9% || Largest Market | Asia Pacific || Base Year | 2025 || Forecast Period | 2025 to 2034 || Segments Covered | Reactor Type, Application and Region || Regions Covered | North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East & Africa |## Market Dynamics### Drivers**Increasing electricity demand**Increasing residential and industrial electricity usage encourages governments to prioritize sustainable power over conventional power generation to reduce their carbon footprint. Furthermore, the increasing electrification of connected devices, transportation, and other critical services is increasing the demand for more power, increasing the demand for tiny modular reactors emitting less carbon. For instance, according to world energy & Climate statistics, global energy consumption shows 5% growth in 2021, After a 4.5% decline in 2020.The growing interest in developing renewable energy sources is expected to open significant industry opportunities. Furthermore, governments worldwide are aware of the deteriorating environmental balance and are taking necessary steps to restore it, including imposing strict limits on hazardous emissions. As a result of these regulations, new investors are flocking to compact modular reactors. Aside from that, the capital needed to construct a small modular reactor facility is less than that required to build a traditional nuclear facility. Small modular reactors necessitate less construction, which reduces investment costs.### Challenges**Regulatory barriers**The first and most significant challenge is the presence of regulatory barriers. Many SMR designs include novel features such as enhanced passive safety systems and multi-modular deployment (i.e., multiple reactor modules on the same site or pool). NuScale, for example). The SMR vendors argue that these features could reduce operational staffing requirements (see discussion in Rothwell, 2016: 168) and the size of emergency planning zones due to the application of regulations. As for any NPP, the safety and  requirements for SMR are precise, but the question is how SMR will demonstrate that they can meet those requirements. Regulators and technical support organizations will also require time to decide on these options and innovations, which may cause delays.### Opportunities**Reduction of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere**SMRs have the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They could provide an alternative baseload power source, allowing the retirement of older, smaller, and less efficient coal-fired power plants that would otherwise not be suitable for retrofitting with carbon capture and storage technology. They could be used in the U.S. and the world where other carbon-free energy sources, such as solar and wind, are scarce. There could be technical or commercial constraints, such as expected energy demand growth and transmission capacity, allowing SMRs but not GW-scale LWRs to be installed. The manufacturing base required for SMRs can be established domestically, which is critical for onshore production.## Segments Insights### Reactor Type InsightsBased on the reactor type, heavy water reactors dominated the market. The heavy water reactors are significantly more expensive than ordinary light water, it provides improved substantially neutron economy, allowing the reactor to operate without fuel enrichment facilities (offsetting the additional expense of the heavy water) and improving the reactor\\'s ability to use alternate fuel cycles. Furthermore, heavy water reactors regulate their isotopic purity for optimal reactor physics performance. For example, increasing the isotopic purity of heavy water improves fuel economy and reduces waste generation. This can be accomplished by minimizing light water ingress into heavy water systems and maximizing the purity of recovered water before it is returned to the reactor. p in controlling isotopic purity to achieve optimal reactor physics performance.### Application InsightsBased on application, the power generation segment dominated the small modular market in 2024and is expected to continue to lead during the forecast period.On the other hand, the desalination segment is the second fastest-growing market owing to the increasing demand for potable water in semi-arid and arid zones.**!**Small molecular reactors are used for nuclear desalination, and where portable water is produced from seawater in the facility. Desalination plants are designed to make portable water or used as co-generation atomic power plants to generate electricity.## Regional Insights### Asia Pacific Small Modular Reactor Market Size and Growth 2025 to 2034The Asia Pacific small modular reactor market size was estimated at USD 5.99 billion in 2025 and is predicted to be worth around USD 12.90 billion by 2034, at a CAGR of 9.1% from 2025 to 2034.**!****Asia Pacific is dominating the** **small modular reactor market and** **is expected to grow in the forecast period**China is highly active in the field of SMRs, with many designs, competition among various manufacturers, and many projects in the planning and construction stages. China is interested in using SMRs for multiple applications, including electricity generation, process, and district heating. China funds several research, development, and demonstration programs for advanced reactors, including Generation III and IV, for commercial and sustainable development.Nuclear power has grown dramatically in China over the last decade because of political decisions to promote technology. The potential market for SMRs is significant within China. How well this translates to the export potential for the SMR designs remains to be seen, as the only Chinese NPP built outside of China is in Pakistan. Various regulatory and other issues could act as roadblocks.!Nowadays, Interest in SMRs has been steadily increasing, but this interest has yet to be translated into many projects. SMR deployment plans are apparent in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, China, and Russia. When contemplating deploying new SMR designs, the FOAK plants become significant for the future, as they can be viewed as demonstration plants in some cases, particularly for non-LWR structures. With clear, national-level interest in the project, the number of actors willing to take a risk on a FOAK SMR is unlimited. Government such as US and UK have signalled their interest in supporting a new build and then exporting the technology. Without this level of support, It is presumable that many designs will die in innovation valley death.U.S. has provided larger-scale support for SMRs since 2012 when the Department of Energy (DOE) allocated USD 450 million to develop an advanced US-based LWR. Initially, the B&W mPower design was given permission, which was later shelved. The DOE has supported a variety of plant designs, but the NuScale 60 MWe SMR is currently the design with the most funding behind it. NuScale is presently undergoing NRC design certification, which is expected to be completed by 2022. The first fully commercial 12-module and 720 MWe plants are expected to come online by 2027 at DOE\\'s Idaho National Laboratory site.The UK government announced a grant of £210 million to Rolls-Royce SMR to match private investment in this venture in 2021. Rolls-Royce Group, BNF Resources UK, and Exelon Generation will each invest £195 million in it over the next three years.

UK-based Tokamak Energy has recorded a significant breakthrough in the development of clean energy by successfully replicating fusion power plant fields within its Demo4 magnet system.This is the first time in the world that such fields have been created in a full High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) magnet configuration.During recent tests conducted at the company’s headquarters near Oxford, the Demo4 system achieved magnetic field strengths of 11.8 Tesla at a temperature of -243 degrees Celsius (-405.4 degrees Fahrenheit).interestingengineering.com# interestingengineering.com is blockedThis page has been blocked by an extension- Try disabling your extensions.ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENTReloadThis page has been blocked by an extension![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)The system, which features a complete set of HTS magnets built in a tokamak configuration, successfully managed seven million ampere-turns of electrical current through its central column.Warrick Matthews, CEO of Tokamak Energy, described the results as a “major victory” for the sector.“Demo4 represents over a decade of HTS innovation at Tokamak Energy. Born from our fusion mission, it validates one of the technical solutions for getting clean, limitless, safe and secure fusion energy on the grid,” Matthews said.## Validating system-level performanceCreating fusion energy requires extremely  to confine and control hydrogen fuel, which is heated to a plasma state several times hotter than the sun’s core. While single high-field HTS magnets have been demonstrated previously, Demo4 addresses the next critical engineering challenge: validating a complete magnet system.In a functioning fusion power plant, superconducting tapes must operate within a complex magnetic environment created by neighboring coils. These conditions significantly influence structural performance and critical current.Demo4 allows engineers to generate and study these fusion-relevant forces across a system coil set, which includes 14 toroidal field magnets and two poloidal field magnets.Graham Dunbar, Demo4 chief engineer, noted that the platform is providing unique engineering data to inform future power plant designs.“This isn’t just about achieving a number; it’s about gaining the confidence and build expertise to scale our technology for future energy-producing fusion systems,” Dunbar .## Commercial applications beyond fusionThe tests also highlighted the commercial potential of HTS technology for sectors outside of fusion energy.HTS materials can deliver approximately 200 times the current density of copper, making them viable for power distribution in data centers, electric motors for zero-emission flight, and magnetic levitation transport systems.According to the company, these magnets can be made smaller and lighter than traditional low-temperature superconductors and operate at a fraction of the cooling cost.Tokamak Energy indicated that further testing to reach higher magnetic fields is ongoing, with the next set of results expected in early 2026.## High-speed plasma imageryIn a related development, the firm earlier released the first high-speed color images of plasma captured inside a fusion energy machine, offering new visual insights into the behavior of the fuel.This research supports the advancement of , a promising operating mode for future fusion power plants. XPR regimes are designed to cool the plasma’s edge before it contacts reactor components, reducing wear on the hardware without compromising performance.The ability to visualize how lithium interacts with the plasma in real-time serves as a significant step toward validating this enabling technology.### Recommended Articles!Get the latest in engineering, tech, space & science - delivered daily to your inbox.Sign up for freeBy subscribing, you agree to ourandYou may unsubscribe at any time.0COMMENTBy An active and versatile journalist and news editor.

The figure marks a significant increase from 2024 and is the second highest yearly fusion funding figure since the report began, after the 2022 record year.Now in its fifth year, the report provides a comprehensive view of the growth of the fusion sector and progress towards commercial fusion deployment. This year, 53 fusion companies responded – up from 23 in 2021 – with eight new entrants since last year.This year’s total figure includes several major funding rounds including the $900m Series A for US-based Pacific Fusion, which came out of stealth mode in November 2024. Other significant rounds included a $425m Series F for US-based Helion in January 2025, and €113m Series B for Germany-based Marvel Fusion.Despite the acceleration in funding, 83% of respondents still consider investment a major challenge. And when asked how much more investment each company would need to bring their first pilot plants online, answers ranged from $3m to $12.5 bn, with a median response of $700m. Giving a total of $77 billion, this is eight times more than has been committed to the industry to date, though the report emphasizes that this should not be taken as the total investment needed, as there will inevitably be some consolidation, with a smaller number of market leaders emerging.Nonetheless, fusion companies remain confident in their timelines for delivering fusion-generated electricity to the grid, with 84% of respondents believing this will happen before the end of the 2030s and 53% by 2035.The report also highlights that backing is coming from a wide range of investors, including deep tech venture capital firms like DCVC and Breakthrough Energy Ventures; industrial giants such as Chevron, Siemens Energy, and Nucor; sovereign and quasi-public funds including In-Q-Tel, the European Innovation Council Fund, and Plynth Energy; and strategic players from the energy sector like Shell Ventures and Energy Impact Partners.The amount of public funding invested in fusion companies also increased by 84% from last year, growing by almost $360 million to nearly $800 million in total.More than half of the fusion energy startups in the report are based in the US (29), while a further 13 are in Europe. The remainder are operating in countries across Asia and Oceania. The survey showed fusion companies directly employ 4,607 people and support at least 9,300 supply chain jobs, though this is likely an undercount as not all companies provided employee data. Since 2021, the number of people employed directly by fusion companies has more than quadrupled.> “With a half-decade of consistent data, we can now identify clear trends that speak to both the promise and challenges of commercial fusion energy. The acceleration of capital, even when the global economy has tightened, is a signal of maturing investor confidence, technological progress, and a rapidly coalescing supply chain. The maturation of the ecosystem, and increased interest from governments via public-private partnerships show fusion is no longer a purely scientific effort; it is a global industrial movement.”>> FIA CEO Andrew Holland**About the Report** This is the fifth annual Global Fusion Industry Report from the Fusion Industry Association. Responses are based on answers to a survey issued to private fusion companies. We approached the fusion developers that we know about and where contact information was available. 52 companies responded to the survey this year. One is in stealth mode so not named. A 53rd did not respond to this year’s survey but confirmed inclusion with last year’s data. All responses are voluntary, and we strive to be impartial and transparent, presenting information on the various companies as it has been conveyed to us. This survey should be seen as a snapshot in time; a view of the industry when the survey was conducted in the second quarter of 2025. Repeating the activity year-on-year enables us to see the picture evolving.Many private fusion companies are members of the Fusion Industry Association, though this is not a requirement for the report, and we strive to treat members and non-members the same. Membership of the FIA requires companies to have a plan for fusion commercialization, to demonstrate private investment to support their mission, and to pay dues. Companies playing a supportive role in the fusion industry as suppliers, customers, and advocacy organizations may join as Affiliate Members, but these wider-industry companies are not the subject of this report.**About The Fusion Industry Association (FIA)** The FIA is the leading voice of the fusion industry and a central point for coordination across the global fusion community to support accelerated growth.Share on Facebook]( Tweet]('}, {'title': 'Global fusion energy investment surges to $2.64bn', 'url': 'https://www.power-technology.com/news/global-fusion-energy-investment-surges-64bn/', 'markdown': ' ![]( fusion, the powerhouse behind the sun and stars, remains in a developmental phase on Earth.
